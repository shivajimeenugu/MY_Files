To delete a corresponding sheet when a row is deleted, we need to modify the code to handle the `Workbook_SheetChange` event for deletions as well. Specifically, the code will need to check if rows are deleted, and if so, remove the corresponding sheets. 

Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Open your Excel workbook**.
2. **Press `Alt + F11`** to open the VBA editor.
3. **Find the `ThisWorkbook` module**:
   - In the VBA editor, locate `ThisWorkbook` under the `VBAProject (YourWorkbookName)` in the Project Explorer on the left.
   - Double-click `ThisWorkbook` to open its code window.

4. **Copy and paste the following VBA code into the `ThisWorkbook` code window**:

    ```vba
    Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range)
        Dim ws As Worksheet
        Dim newSheetName As String
        Dim monitoredSheets As Variant
        Dim sheetName As Variant
        Dim mainSheetName As String
        Dim backShape As Shape
        Dim cell As Range

        ' Define the main sheet name
        mainSheetName = "MainSheet" ' Replace with the name of your main sheet
        
        ' List of sheet names to monitor
        monitoredSheets = Array("Sheet1", "Sheet2") ' Replace with the names of the sheets you want to monitor

        ' Check if the change is in a monitored sheet
        For Each sheetName In monitoredSheets
            If Sh.Name = sheetName Then
                ' Handle additions or changes in the first column
                If Not Intersect(Target, Sh.Columns(1)) Is Nothing Then
                    For Each cell In Target
                        If Len(cell.Value) > 0 Then
                            newSheetName = cell.Value
                            ' Check if the sheet name already exists
                            On Error Resume Next
                            Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(newSheetName)
                            On Error GoTo 0

                            ' If the sheet does not exist, create it
                            If ws Is Nothing Then
                                Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add(After:=ThisWorkbook.Sheets(ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Count))
                                ws.Name = newSheetName

                                ' Create a back icon shape in the new sheet
                                Set backShape = ws.Shapes.AddShape(msoShapeLeftArrow, 10, 10, 50, 50)
                                backShape.TextFrame.Characters.Text = "Back"

                                ' Add a hyperlink to the main sheet
                                ws.Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=backShape, Address:="", SubAddress:="'" & mainSheetName & "'!A1", TextToDisplay:="Back"
                            End If

                            ' Insert a hyperlink in the cell to the new sheet
                            Sh.Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=cell, Address:="", SubAddress:="'" & newSheetName & "'!A1", TextToDisplay:=newSheetName

                            Set ws = Nothing
                        End If
                    Next cell
                End If
            End If
        Next sheetName
    End Sub

    Private Sub Workbook_SheetBeforeDelete(ByVal Sh As Object)
        Dim ws As Worksheet
        Dim monitoredSheets As Variant
        Dim sheetName As Variant
        Dim cell As Range
        Dim targetSheetName As String
        
        ' List of sheet names to monitor
        monitoredSheets = Array("Sheet1", "Sheet2") ' Replace with the names of the sheets you want to monitor

        ' Check if the sheet being deleted is a monitored sheet
        For Each sheetName In monitoredSheets
            If Sh.Name = sheetName Then
                ' Iterate over each cell in the first column of the monitored sheet
                For Each cell In Sh.Columns(1).Cells
                    If Len(cell.Value) > 0 Then
                        targetSheetName = cell.Value
                        ' Check if the sheet name exists and delete it
                        On Error Resume Next
                        Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(targetSheetName)
                        On Error GoTo 0

                        If Not ws Is Nothing Then
                            Application.DisplayAlerts = False
                            ws.Delete
                            Application.DisplayAlerts = True
                        End If

                        Set ws = Nothing
                    End If
                Next cell
            End If
        Next sheetName
    End Sub
    ```

5. **Close the VBA editor** and return to your workbook.
6. **Save the workbook** as a macro-enabled workbook (`*.xlsm`).

### Explanation:
- **Workbook_SheetChange Event**: Handles creating new sheets and adding hyperlinks when a new row is added or modified in monitored sheets.
- **Workbook_SheetBeforeDelete Event**: Handles deleting the corresponding sheet when a row is deleted from the monitored sheets.
- **Application.DisplayAlerts**: Prevents Excel from showing confirmation prompts when deleting sheets.

### How to Test:
1. Open one of the sheets listed in the `monitoredSheets` array (e.g., "Sheet1" or "Sheet2").
2. Add a new row and enter a value in the first column (Column A). A new sheet should be created with that name, and a hyperlink should be added to the cell.
3. Delete the row you added. The corresponding sheet should be deleted automatically.

### Important Notes:
- Replace `mainSheetName` with the actual name of your main sheet.
- Ensure that the names you enter in the first column are valid sheet names (i.e., they do not contain any invalid characters such as `\ / * [ ] : ?`).
- Macros must be enabled for this to work. When you open the workbook, make sure to enable macros if prompted.

This code ensures that a new sheet is created and linked via a hyperlink when a new value is entered in the first column of monitored sheets. It also deletes the corresponding sheet when the row is deleted.
